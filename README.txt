See an example of the ACF Flexible Content Layout before you select it!

== Description ==

Note: This requires ACF Pro.

This plugin allows you to upload image examples to your uploads directory so that your clients (or users) can see
an example of what the ACF Flexible Content Layout looks like before they select it.

Be sure to review the INSTALLATION guide!

== Installation ==

To install:

1. Upload `acf-fc-layout-previews` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Upload JPG images of your flexible content layouts into your uploads/acf-fc-layouts directory. The name of the image should be the slug of the template name.

For example, if you have a layout "Hero", then you must upload "hero.jpg" into uploads/acf-fc-layouts.

Another example, if you have a layout titled "Content row with side image", then you must name the image "content-row-with-side-image.jpg"

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What types of images are allowed? =

Currently, only jpeg. The file extension must be "jpg" - all lowercase. Example: hero.jpg

= Why isn't this more dynamic? =

I don't have the time. It's on my todo list, but feel free to contribute!

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
