See an example of the ACF Flexible Content Layout before you select it!

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to upload image examples to your uploads directory so that your clients (or users) can see
an example of what the ACF Flexible Content Layout looks like in the page editor before they select it. This modifies
the existing tooltip to display an image.

Be sure to review the INSTALLATION guide!

== Installation ==

To install:

1. Upload `acf-fc-layout-previews` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Upload JPG images of your flexible content layouts into your uploads/acf-fc-layouts directory.

NOTE: The name of the image should be the name of the flexible layout with the ".jpg" extension.

For example, if you have a layout "Hero", then you must upload "hero.jpg" into _upload-dir_/acf-fc-layouts.

Another example, if you have a layout titled "Content row with side image", then you must name the image "content-row-with-side-image.jpg"

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
